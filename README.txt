This program demonstrates the implementation of bullet physics for collision detection in a 3D environment where you can control the 3d object and make it interact with other objects around it.
Press C to change the physics engine
= USE (x86) for run the project
=To run the project,first of all build all three solutions.

Key presses:
W = Move in forward direction 
S = Move backwards
A = Move left
D = Move right

= For the Camera, use arrow key to zoom in, zoom out and change the direction of camera.

= For DEBUG RENDERING : '9' => to activate the debug rendering.
			'0' => to deactivate debug rendering.

= All of the models load with an external text file which is inside the FirstOpenGl folder("Scene.txt").
